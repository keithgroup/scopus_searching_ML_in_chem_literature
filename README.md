Scopus searches of machine learning algorithms in chemistry literature
==============================
Repository that contains data and a Jupyter notebook that creates a heatmap visualization of the number of scientific papers that relate to the 
[ACS technical divisions](https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/membership-and-networks/join/websites.html) and mention names of machine learning algorithms. 

This visualization is found in the following paper:

V. Vasilev-Galindo, S. Chiemela, J. A. Keith, K.-R. Mueller, A. Tkatchenko. "Combining Machine Learning and Computational Chemistry for Predictive Insights Into Chemical Systems." (In preparation)
